# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
RAG is a model architecture that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models. The idea is to use an external retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant documents or information from a large dataset (such as a knowledge base or the internet) and then use a generative model (like GPT) to generate more accurate, contextually relevant, and informative responses based on the retrieved information.

### How RAG works:
* Retrieval: The model first retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base or database using a search mechanism (e.g., embedding-based search or traditional information retrieval techniques).
* Generation: After retrieving the relevant information, a generative model (like GPT or BERT) uses that information to generate a response, answer a query, or provide more accurate and detailed outputs.
